# tatarverse.cc

Static multilingual Astro catalog of Tatar, Bashkir, Tatar-Bashkir, and Crimean Tatar communities, centers, sources, translations, and reference materials.

## Status

The project is prepared for focused open-source contributions. The most useful changes are verified center-data updates, English translations, source references, accessibility fixes, and small UI improvements that preserve the existing visual language.

Current public locale surface:

- `ru` - default source routes and source center entries.
- `en` - localized routes and translated center entries.

## Stack

- Astro 6 static output.
- MDX content collections.
- Tailwind CSS v4 through `@tailwindcss/vite`.
- Bun as the preferred package manager.
- Cloudflare Pages deployment through Wrangler.

## Contributing

Keep contributions focused and easy to review. Use the guide in the language most convenient for you:

- [Русский](./CONTRIBUTING.ru.md)
- [English](./CONTRIBUTING.en.md)

## Translations

UI dictionaries live in `src/i18n/locales`. Center translations live in `src/data/centers_i18n/en`.

When adding a UI string:

1. Add the same key to every active locale file.
2. Use an existing key namespace such as `nav.*`, `list.*`, `detail.*`, `copy.*`, or `feedback.*`.
3. In components, use `useTranslations(locale)` and `t("key.name")`.
4. Do not leave hardcoded user-facing text in components.

## Content And SEO

- Preserve stable `tbk-*` slugs.
- Preserve canonical route behavior and localized links.
- Keep headings meaningful and structured.
- Preserve source links and factual intent.
- Avoid broad MDX formatting churn.
- Be careful with metadata, robots behavior, structured data, and visible page titles.
